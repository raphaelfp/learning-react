# High-Order Component

A simple High-Order Component app with React and Redux.

## What is a High-Order Component?

> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature. Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
