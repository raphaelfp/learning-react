# React/NodeJS authentication using Mongo

This is a example of a real world authentication flow in React, NodeJS and Mongo, using passport, JWT and bcrypt to handle all the authentication steps.

### Getting Started

```
> git clone https://github.com/raphaelfp/learning-react.git
> cd learning-react\auth\auth-server
> npm install
> node index.js
> Open another tab
> cd learning-react\auth\auth-server
> npm install
> npm start
```

Mongo needs to be running on "mongodb://localhost:auth/auth"
