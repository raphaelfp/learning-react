# Third-party library integration with React

I created this app show how to integrate React with third-party libraries. It shows a 5-days weather for any city in the World, and uses React, Redux, [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps), [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

### Getting Started

```
> git clone https://github.com/raphaelfp/learning-react.git 
> cd learning-react\third-party
> npm install
> npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
